# EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
My journey on learning exploratory data analysis. I discuss basic EDA concepts and demonstrate using a dataset used by one of AI Saturdays members. I chose it because it was a simple dataset with a lot of what I needed to demonstrate these concepts
. I was inspired to do this because it seemed to me that when it comes to machine learning a lot more focus is on the models rather data.

### What is EDA

A process to uncover underlying insights about the data.

### Why EDA is important

Saves time

Helps in extracting and engineering features

Understand why your model fails/succeeds

Help understand validate or dispell assumptions

Can give better understanding about the domain one can easily ask the right questions

### EDA Concepts

1. Visualizing data
2. Statistical summaries and inferences
3. Cleaning
4. Feature selection, engineering and extraction



## [Dataset](Data/BusiaTravel.csv)
The data documents tracks travel of out and into Busia.

**Travel_Route** : Whether it is an arrival or departure

**Visitors_in_Transit** : Number of visitors passing through Busia

**Visitors_on_Holiday** : Number of visitors on holiday in Busia

**Visitors_on_Business** : Number of visitors on business in Busia

**Other_Visitors** : Visitors whose purpose has not been specified

**Year** : The date of travel

**Year_text** : Extracted year

**Results_Status** : No fucking idea what this is

**OBJECTID** : Index of rows

This notebook discusses ways to summarize data and types of data distributions

## [Data Preparation](Data-Preparation.ipynb)
This notebook discusses ways to prepare data before passing to model

## [Images](Images)
Images used to illustrate concepts

## [Visualization](Visualization.ipynb)
This notebook discusses various types of plots
